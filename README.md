<p align="justify"> The project presents the Healthcare chatbot application, especially for symptom checking and mental support. The primary purpose is to provide individuals with a convenient and reliable tool for assessing their health condition based on the symptoms they are experiencing. It is an initial step for users to gain insights into potential health issues and make informed decisions about seeking medical attention.  It can help patients identify their symptoms, learn about potential conditions, and connect with mental health resources. The chatbot can also be used to educate patients about their health and to provide support during times of illness. The advantage of the application is, that it is available 24/7 and mainly developed for rural areas where people are unaware of the symptoms. The chatbot is trained on a dataset of symptoms, and descriptions. The chatbot employs SVM, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to analyse and classify symptoms effectively, resulting in accurate disease predictions. The integration of SVM and Streamlit showcases the potential for innovative technologies to enhance healthcare accessibility and user engagement. The chatbot's user-centric design empowers individuals to take charge of their health by providing valuable insights, potential diagnoses, and mental health resources. This amalgamation of technology and healthcare exemplifies a forward-looking approach that could reshape how individuals engage with their health and well-being. </p>
